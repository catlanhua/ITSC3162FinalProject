# ITSC3162FinalProject
This is group 5's final project for Data Mining. In this project, our group decided to predict the prices of cars, which might be helpful for anyone whoâ€™s looking to purchase cars or making an investment in cars in the future. The goal of this project is to use regression analysis to predict the car prices based on multiple features of different car makes and models. The questions we are trying to answer are:

1. What features have the most impact on car prices?
2. What are the pricing dynamics of the current car market?


Initial Task List:
- [x] Discussing and deciding on which models to use: due by 04/22
- [x] Inspecting and cleaning the data: due by 04/25
- [x] Data visualization: due by 04/25
- [x] Getting the report started: due by 04/25 
- [x] Modeling and evaluating performance: due by 04/29
- [x] Creating the presentation: due by 05/02
